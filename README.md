## Description

Welcome to the first version (MVP) of AssetPortal! We truly appreciate your interest in the project!

AssetPortal aims to be the gateway to the ecosystem. Leveraging the structure of Asset Hub, we are in the process of creating an open-source platform that allows interaction with the ecosystem in a simple and intuitive way, simplifying and unifying processes into a single portal.

We are aware of the importance of Asset Hub, the idea of transferring token holding from the Polkadot relay chain, and the limitations it currently faces due to a lack of UX/UI. That is why we decided to create this portal and aim to increase the number of Asset Hub users and the ecosystem as a whole.

Our goal is to create a portal where users can send their tokens from a CEX to Asset Hub (to the wallet of their choice), view their assets, and from there provide the corresponding facilities to enable them to transfer those tokens to the parachain of their choice or interact with Asset Hub.

Also, our idea is to collaborate with various projects to introduce them to the users, and provide ease of discovery for new projects within the ecosystem (which can often be overwhelming, especially for new Polkadot users), and help the ecosystem grow. We are completely open to dialogue with any project and willing to prepare something together (whether it be functionalities, information, or anything) as long as it benefits the ecosystem.

## Features

In AssetPortal, users will be able to:

- View their wallet balances (either in read-only mode or by connecting an installed wallet).
- Transfer their tokens.
- Use XCM to redirect their tokens to a parachain.
- Discover the DEFI ecosystem of Polkadot.
- Swap assets on the Asset Hub pallet.
- Use the Polkadot-Kusama bridge.
- Create and mint new assets.
- Manage the assets they've created.
- Interact with their NFTs.
- And more.
